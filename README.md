## Overview
MartiniSurf builds complete GROMACS-ready simulation folders for:
- Protein-surface systems (Martini 3 workflow)
- DNA-surface systems (Martini2 DNA workflow)
- Linker-mediated immobilization workflows

## Documentation
- Published docs (GitHub Pages): https://biokt.github.io/MartiniSurf/
- Beginner-friendly complete guide (including full flag-by-flag reference): `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`

Main capabilities:
- Coarse-graining via `martinize2` (protein) or `martinize-dna.py` (DNA)
- Local structure inputs in PDB or mmCIF/PDBx (`.pdb`, `.cif`, `.mmcif`) formats
- Tunable `martinize2` protein controls, including GoMartini, elastic-network, secondary-structure, and controlled extra arguments
- Surface generation or reuse of provided surfaces
- Not explicit linker (anchor) or linker-based orientation
- Automatic topology assembly

## Installation
```bash
conda create -n martinisurf python=3.11 -y
conda activate martinisurf
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Automatic protein preparation

Protein-mode runs now prepare protein-only input before `martinize2`, with no
extra flag needed (also applies to the Streamlit workflow). Reinstall dependencies
after updating: `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .`.

- Keep the first structural model and select one alternate conformation per
  residue by mean occupancy (ties prefer A).
- Remove waters, nucleic acids, ions, heme, glycans and other nonprotein residues.
  Standard amino acids in HETATM records are retained; MSE is explicitly
  converted to MET. Other unidentified protein modifications require review.
- Rebuild missing side-chain heavy atoms using PDBFixer/OpenMM. Terminal atoms
  are left to martinize2's terminal patches. Missing backbone atoms, internal
  numbering gaps and abnormal peptide distances stop with a residue-specific
  error; missing loops are never automatically invented.
- Preserve PDB chain/residue IDs through repair and reject empty or non-finite
  coordinate output, including CG output from an otherwise successful command.

`2_system/original_input.*` preserves the source, `prepared_protein.pdb` contains
repairs, and `protein_preparation.json` records removals, alternate choices,
MSE replacements, added atoms and deferred terminal atoms. Reconstructed atoms
are modeled coordinates, not experimental observations. The cleaned structure
represents **protein only**, not the original holo/glycosylated complex. Use the
pre-CG complex workflow when cofactors or other components are required.

DNA and pre-CG complex workflows do not use this protein repair. Local mmCIF
inputs still pass through the existing MDTraj-to-PDB conversion; identifiers
may be normalized during that conversion. Arbitrary modified amino acids,
cyclic/capped peptides and unresolved chain breaks may require manual preparation.

## External Tools
MartiniSurf expects the following tools in your environment:
- `martinize2` for protein mode
- Python 2.7 for DNA mode (`martinize-dna.py`)
- GROMACS for running the generated workflows


## Quick Start (Recommended Examples)
Examples are grouped by topic under `martinisurf/examples/protein`, `martinisurf/examples/dna`, and `martinisurf/examples/surfaces`.
The main ready-to-use workflows are:

- `martinisurf/examples/protein/04_anchor_solvate_ionize`
- `martinisurf/examples/dna/03_linker_solvate_ionize_freeze`
- `martinisurf/examples/protein/05_pre_cg_nad_substrate`

Typical run pattern for the full workflow examples (`protein/04`, `dna/03`, `protein/05`):
```bash
cd martinisurf/examples/protein/04_anchor_solvate_ionize
bash run.sh
bash work_flow_gromacs.sh
```

DNA workflow note:
- `dna/03` runs `minimization -> nvt -> deposition (NPT) -> production (NVT)`.
- The pressure-coupled equilibration is handled in `deposition`; there is no separate DNA `npt.mdp` stage in this example.

## Google Colab Notebooks

## Streamlit Protein Designer
The protein workflow is also available as a local Streamlit app:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-streamlit.txt
pip install -e .
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
See `docs/streamlit_app.md` for deployment notes.

## Linker Mode Notes
- `--anchor` and `--linker-group` accept either legacy global residue ids or chain-based residue ids from the input PDB:
  - Legacy: `--anchor 1 8 10 11`
  - Chain-based: `--anchor B 8 10 11`
  - Chain-based groups are converted internally to global residue ids in input order, so the first group still becomes `Anchor_1`, the second `Anchor_2`, and so on.
- Chain-based syntax is available for `--pdb` workflows.
- In `--complex-config`, chain-based `protein.anchor_groups` are also supported when `protein.reference_pdb` points to the source PDB used to build the pre-CG complex.
- The linker topology file must exist next to linker GRO with matching basename:
  - Example: `linker.gro` -> `linker.itp`
- You can reverse linker orientation with:
  - `--invert-linker`
- For terminal His-tag immobilization, `--histag` uses a terminal/local tail window around the selected residues to orient the tag more vertically toward the surface. Adjust the tail window with `--histag-window` (default `10`).
- For multiple linker instances, pull/index groups are generated per linker automatically.
- If not provided manually, linker distances are estimated from Martini bead-size sigma rules.
- `--surface-linkers N` decorates unique top-layer surface sites as a monolayer and caps placement at the number of available top-layer sites; for example, requesting 500 linkers on a surface with 264 top sites places 264 surface linkers.
- Local `2-1` / `4-1` multilayer surfaces use HCP-like ABAB stacking by default; use `--surface-stacking fcc` to generate ABCABC stacking instead.
- For Martini 3 protein workflows, `--water-mix` can tune the final solvent composition among `W`, `SW`, and `TW` after solvation; for example, `--water-mix SW:0.10,TW:0.10` keeps 80% `W`, 10% `SW`, and 10% `TW`.
